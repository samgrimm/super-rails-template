##SuperMegaUltra Rails App Generator Template!

This app was created using the template located [here](link pending).

###It has the following items pre-configured:
* Bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome
* Devise
* SendGrid
* friendly_id
* gritter
* i18n-tasks
* Custom scaffold templates
* Navbar partial and helpers

###What it will do:
* Install the gems listed above and their dependencies
* Configure RSPEC with Factory Girl, Warden, and database_cleaner
* Update the application assets to get bootstrap, FontAwesome, and gritter
* Update application.rb with generator configuration and locale configuration
* Update application_controller with locale method
* Update the application layout to contain a Navbar and the calls to gritter
* Add helper methods to the application_helper to help edit the navbar, gritter
* Add initializers for i18n-tasks and sendgrid setup
* Add locale files for EN and PT with some of the basic tags already translated
* Run i18n-tasks to capture other i18n-tasks
* Add generator templates for the scaffold that include locale paths, i18n tags, and some bootstrap styles
* Modify the scaffold generator, so that new scaffolds will run i18n-tasks at the end to capture the missing i18n tags
* Add the locale scope to routes.rb
* runs the first db:create and db:migrate
* Create a static_pages controller with a home (directed to root_path) and an about page
* Run the initial Git Commit command, so you start off great with git, and push to github all from the very first command
